# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added the initial `@gajae-code/bridge-client` TypeScript SDK for the GJC backend bridge, including authenticated handshake/command/event helpers, controller/UI/host callback APIs, idempotency-key helpers, and a minimal reference consumer renderer.
- Documented that the SDK is experimental and tracks `BRIDGE_PROTOCOL_VERSION` 1: `command()` and the typed command helpers return `Promise<unknown>` (callers narrow responses themselves), and the package intentionally does not import `@gajae-code/coding-agent` internal `rpc-types` to preserve the package boundary. Stable shared protocol response types are tracked as follow-up work.
